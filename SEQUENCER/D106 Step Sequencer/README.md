# D106 Step Sequencer

This project contains the firmware source code for the D106 Step Sequencer.
This project can be found [here](http://dintree.com/#D106).

This code is free to use for non-commercial use only. Please see the
project website for more details.

This code is written for the PIC16F690 micrcontroller and is compiled with
the SourceBoost BoostC compiler version 6.x. Other compilers are possible
but you will probably have to change some of the built-in macros for I/O
ports, registers, etc.

Have fun!
